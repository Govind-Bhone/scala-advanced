/*

The typical definition of purity (and the one we use in our book) goes something like this:

An expression e is referentially transparent if for all programs p, every occurrence of e in p can be replaced with the result of evaluating e without changing the result of evaluating p.

A function f is pure if the expression f(x) is referentially transparent for all referentially transparent x.
